### Overview
    Creators compendium is an app developed to enhance writing and organization, be it for novels, comics, or even dnd campaigns. the main objective is to build an app that you can create quick notes almost instantly, and then later format those into complex notes utilizing a myriad of tools. 

    Stretch goals are to create a glossary of writing terms and structures, a text editor, and potentially more.

### How to run the program
    Creators Compendium is built as a PWA (progressive web app) utilizing react as a framework.

    After downloading the repository, to run as a pwa use 
    npm run build >> npm start

### Brief Roadmap
    As of right now, I currently have 4 sections planned out: simple notes, complex notes with an accompanying details page, text editor, and glossary/information with an accompanying details page. Also a section for settings and whatnot, and eventually i want to build a tutorial.

### User Stories
    #### App Stories
        1) as a user, I should be able to navigate pages via hamburger bun
        2) as a user, I should be able to store my data locally and back it up to a backend (eventually) for quick accessibility
        3) as a user, I should be able to manually save and send information to backend (like push changes)
        4) as a user, I should be able to resolve any data conflicts easily and be notified when there is a conflict in a non-interruptive way
        3) (stretch)as a user, I should be able to access and turn on accessibility features, such as color shifting, dyslexia accessible fonts, and more.

        5) as a user, I should be able to delete notes, with the app asking for confirmation of intent to delete
        6) as a user, I should be able to add quick, preset tags (both on the dev side and by me, the user) to my notes for easy finding
        7) as a user, I should be able to search my notes for keywords and tags
        8) as a user, I should be able to  create new custom tags

    #### Complex Notes
        1) as a user, I should be able to access a page that displays complex notes
        2) as a user, I should be able to create a complex note that has a basic description, title, and links to a note details page
        3) as a user, I should be able to access and convert basic notes data into a series of detailed notes templates
        4) as a user, I should be able to delete complex notes with user confirmation
        5) as a user, I should be able to add tags to notes for easy searching
        6) as a user, I should be able to add as many tags as i like (maybe within reason)
        7) as a user, I should be able to search by tags and names, and potentially more

        ##### Complex notes Details page
            1) as a user, when I click a complex note it should take me to a page with advanced details for that note.
            2) as a user, I should be able to edit complex notes information on this page.
            3) as a user, I should be able to name and tag complex notes in details page.
            4) as a user, I should be able to access basic notes and copy info from them to add to the complex notes.

            5) (stretch) as a user, I should be able to change the details of a complex note to a couple preset templates for different writing elements.
            5.25) examples of template elments might be : name, info, gallery (store links to images), timelines, relationship trees, etc.
            5.5) (stretch of a stretch) make those templates modular so user can build custom templates

        1) as a user, I should be able to see a glossary section that shows a list of writing terms, principles, and structures to reference in writings.
        2) as a user, glossary terms should be simple to navigate due to good organization (ie should be under different appropriate headers, sections, etc.)
        3) as a user, I should be able to search for relevant terms, and terms perhaps should be tagged.
        4) as a user, I should be able to see basic definitions and usages for each term.
